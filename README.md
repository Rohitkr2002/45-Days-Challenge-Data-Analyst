# 45-Days-Challenge-Data-Analyst

Welcome to my 45-Days Data Analyst Challenge! This repository contains my learning journey, practice exercises, projects, and insights from a 45-day structured challenge to become proficient in Data Analysis using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Visualization tools.

# 🏆 Objective

The goal of this challenge is to build strong data analysis skills through consistent practice, hands-on exercises, and real-world datasets. By the end of 45 days, I aim to:
Understand the end-to-end data analysis workflow
Master data manipulation and cleaning using Python libraries
Perform statistical analysis and data visualization
Gain confidence in working with real-world datasets

# 📅 Challenge Structure
